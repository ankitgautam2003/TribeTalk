# TribeTalk

TribeTalk is a responsive Reddit-style clone built as part of my journey to learn full-stack app development with **Flutter** and **Firebase**.  

The application allows users to create and manage communities, share posts in different formats, and interact with others through voting and commenting. It also includes authentication, user profiles, and theme customization.

## How It Works

1. Users can sign up or log in with Google or Email/Password.  
2. Communities can be created and customized, with moderators managing them.  
3. Posts can contain text, links, or images.  
4. Other users can upvote, downvote, and comment on posts.  
5. Profiles display user activity and community roles.  
6. A theme toggle allows switching between light and dark mode.

## Architecture

- **Flutter** – Handles the frontend UI and ensures a smooth cross-platform experience.  
- **Firebase** – Provides backend services such as authentication, Firestore database, and storage.  
- **Riverpod** – Manages state across the application for scalability and maintainability.

## Learning Objective

The goal of developing TribeTalk was to practice and strengthen my understanding of **full-stack mobile app development** while working on a real-world style application.
